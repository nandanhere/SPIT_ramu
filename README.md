# Drishti  


The one stop destination for institution search.  
Drishti has the following features:  
<ol>
  <li>College Search : Search colleges based on various requirements and filters such as location, cutoff etc. </li>  <br>
  
  <li>Map Service : The map service allows us to look at colleges as pins and then view their information on floating modals</li>  <br>
  <li>Chat Bot: The chat bot makes it a truly personal experience as the user can immerse in the application in order to look for their queries on the fly without having to mechanically type. This also makes the app more accessible.</li>  <br>
  <li>View College Details: Experience the look and feel of your college in our applications gallery using the carousel feature to scroll through various images of the institution of your choice.</li>  <br>
  <li>Discussion: The discussions section allows our user to ask questions and respond to them on the forum in order to find first hand experience records and also double check the college of their choice. We believe that the discussion section can be the first step for a fresher to get to know seniors, teachers and other friends before joining college in this virtual world.</li>  <br>
  <li>Database : Our Database is fully seeded through webscraping various college websites.</li>
